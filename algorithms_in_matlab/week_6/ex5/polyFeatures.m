function [X_poly] = polyFeatures(X, p)
%POLYFEATURES Maps X (1D vector) into the p-th power
%   [X_poly] = POLYFEATURES(X, p) takes a data matrix X (size m x 1) and
%   maps each example into its polynomial features where
%   X_poly(i, :) = [X(i) X(i).^2 X(i).^3 ...  X(i).^p];
%


% You need to return the following variables correctly.

X_poly = zeros(numel(X), p);

for j=1:p
   X_poly(:, j) = X(:,1) .^j;
end
